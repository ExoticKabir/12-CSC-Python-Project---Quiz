# 12-CSC-Python-Project---Quiz

This is my 2021 Level 2 CSC Project. The point of this program is to identify how adept the user is with mathematics and helps them get better. 
This program interacts with the student identifying which areas of the subject the student has difficulties with. 
However, on top of identifying certain flaws in the participantsâ€™ understanding of mathematics, my program will also assist the end-user in learning about mathematics. 
I will achieve this by sending my end-user to a website which will help them learn.
